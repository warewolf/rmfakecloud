It's working great, sync, emails and handwriting recognition are all good. I am using the local proxy config and have now tested a working HTTPS connection for increased security (comments appreciated). Currently, my understanding is that in the default config, the proxy is just establishing an HTTP proxy connection as the rmfakecloud is served on http://server:3000. I would like to have this working on public IP networks too and have set up a NAT rule to forward port 3000 to my local server. This works but I guess it's all unencrypted. note that once HTTPS is working, direct forwarding of port 3000 should be disabled! So, to get it working via HTTPS, I think all we need to do is to set up a reverse HTTPS proxy on the server. NB: I initially tried this with Apache2 but couldn't get the websockets working . The error on the server was this: INFO[0387] accepting websocket abc INFO[0387] upgrade:websocket: the client is not using the websocket protocol: 'upgrade' token not found in 'Connection' header INFO[0387] closing the ws INFO[0387] [GIN] 2020/11/17 - 13:39:41 | 400 | 201.78\u00b5s | 127.0.0.1 | GET \"/notifications/ws/json/1\" So, I tried with an nginx reverse proxy with the following config: server { # increase max request size (for large PDFs) client_max_body_size 200M; server_name rmfakecloud.server.net; listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/rmfakecloud.server.net/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/rmfakecloud.server.net/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot location / { proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\"; proxy_read_timeout 1d; proxy_send_timeout 1d; } } } That seems to work well. There were two other config changes to make: set the STORAGE_URL on the server: export STORAGE_URL=https://rmfakecloud.server.net change the proxy URL on the device: stop services systemctl stop xochitl systemctl stop proxy edit the proxy address nano /etc/systemd/system/proxy.service change the line ExecStart to have the new address ... ExecStart=/home/root/scripts/rmfakecloud/secure -cert /home/root/scripts/rmfakecloud/proxy.crt -key /home/root/scripts/rmfakecloud/proxy.key https://rmfakecloud.server.net ... reload and start services systemctl daemon-reload systemctl start proxy systemctl start xochitl I think this is all good, happy to hear feedback but I think we should amend a section on the README to show how to configure with HTTPS.
